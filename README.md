# hugo-theme-toastersrocks

My vaporwave theme for Hugo. Made it mostly for myself, but feel free to look at it and maybe even improve it, I guess. Let me know if you use it!

## Credits

This theme uses some of my favourite fonts:

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) (icons)
- [IBM VGA from the Ultimate Oldschool PC Font Pack](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/) (mono font)
- Chaloult (base text and title)

Vaporwave background by myself ([get it here!](https://www.deviantart.com/juju2143/art/juju2143-ca-v11-857180659))

Default icon from the [classic After Dark Flying Toasters screensaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Dark_(software))
